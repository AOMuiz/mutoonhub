    summary:
      'There is no God worthy of worship except Allah." This fundamental Islamic statement of faith sums up the concept of tawheed, or perfect monotheism. That there is one and only one God is the basis of all monotheistic religion. Yet, despite the simplicity of this belief, many people who claim to believe in one divine Creator have fallen into errors which negate their testimony of faith. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhâb, the great Muslim scholar and reformer of the 12th century H (18th century CE), was inspired to write Kitâb at-Tawheed because he saw Muslims who had corrupted their beliefs and actions by that which contradicted the pure monotheistic position of Islam. He witnessed the religious veneration of historical sites and graves, supplications made for the intercession of deceased saints, belief in omens, distortions of the meanings of Allah’s names and attributes, and the use of expressions which contradict the belief in Allah’s Oneness. In an effort to purify Islam from this falsehood, the esteemed Shaykh collected proofs from the Noble Qur’an and the teaching of Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing be upon him) to explain all aspects of true monotheism.',

    summary:
      "The author of this book is al-Barbahāree, and his name is: al-Hasan bin ‛Alī bin Khalaf al-Barbahāree, this title being an affiliation to “Barbahār” which is a type of medicine[1], so perhaps he used to work in the field of medicines or sell it. He was from the major Hanbalee scholars taking knowledge from those who studied under Imām Ahmad bin Hanbal, such as al-Marroozee[2] and others. He studied thoroughly, and delved deeply into knowledge. He acquired the ‛aqīdah, fiqh and other knowledge from the great scholars[3]. The title of the book is Sharh as-Sunnah, i.e. Explanation of the Sunnah – the intent of the term Sunnah here is The Path of the Messenger. The intent here is not that of the terminology employed by the Scholars of Hadīth who state: “The Sunnah is whatever is affirmed upon the Prophet of statements, actions or tacit approvals,” rather the intent is more general, that being: The Path of the Messenger, The Path of his Companions and the Path of the Pious Predecessors (as-Salaf as-Sālih) – and this is the Sunnah that has been transmitted and passed down, whether it be in belief, in worship, in fiqh, or in manners and ettiquette. All of this is referred to as the Sunnah in a general sense.",

    summary:
      "The creed (‘aqeedah) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah was penned down by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allaah’s mercy be upon him) in his great work Usoolus-Sunnah translated as The Foundations of the Sunnah. The Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah by consensus – the one who remained firm and steadfast in the times of tribulation in which the people of misguidance compelled the people with their saying that the Qur’an was created along with the denial and distortion of the Attributes of Allaah. So Allaah, the Most High, made the truth clear by way of Imām Ahmad (rahimahullāh), the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah – born in the year 161H and died in 241H. The term Sunnah in the title refers to the belief and the ‘aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.",
